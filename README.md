# ✨Inspiration
We created UnitySpace, a social media platform for the LGBTQ+ community because we believe that everyone deserves to have a safe space to be themselves. We want to provide a platform where people can express themselves, make friends, attend community events and find support. We were inspired by the lack of safe spaces online for members of the LGBTQ+ community to socialize in. We noticed that meeting and interacting with people online has become our new normal since the pandemic started.
We hope that our platform can help make the internet a more welcoming and inclusive place for everyone.

# What it does❓
"UnitySpace" is an all-in-one platform for the LGBTQIA+ community.
Our social media platform is a safe and welcoming space for LGBTQ+ people and allies to connect and interact. You can use it to:
- Find support
- Share your experiences
- Express yourself
- Attend events

Initially, we were unaware, however, during this project, we researched and were able to become aware of the variety of the problems that the community faces and to understand the gravity of their situation.

# 🚀 How we have used **Github** in our project?

We used Github in different ways:

**Pull Requests and Issues:** As a team, we use GitHub pull requests to manage our work. When a team member has an idea for a new feature, they create an issue for the team to discuss and provide feedback on how to implement it..

**Github Branches** Github branches helped us beta test updated code before merging it into the original code. We used branches to create isolated environments for testing, which helped us to avoid conflicts and ensure that the new code was working as expected.

**Github Templates** We choose to use the MIT license for our project, and we added it to our repository using the default license template provided by GitHub.
